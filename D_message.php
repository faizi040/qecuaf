                        We are fully committed to implement QAA policies here in our university by establishing a formal
                        Quality Enhancement Cell. Our university is one of the 10 universities where QEC has been
                        established by HEC. We strongly adhere to the concept of Quality Assurance in institutions of
                        higher
                        learning with enhanced levels of International compatibility through capacity building. I am
                        confident that QEC will work hard to improve the quality of higher education being imparted in
                        University of Agriculture, Faisalabad and to bring it at par with most of the international
                        professional universities.The QEC at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad is strongly committed
                        to
                        implement the guidelines and policies of Quality Assurance Agency Higher Commission Education
                        (HEC)
                        in its true spirit. The Higher Education Institutions in Pakistan are facing great challenges
                        especially in comparison with international standards. Our QEC- UAF Mission Statement and
                        Objectives

                        QEC-UAF will deliver quality and standardized education to produce competitive graduates in all
                        disciplines. Quality Enhancement Cell, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (QEC-UAF)
                        University of
                        Agriculture, Faisalabad has managed to have remarkable achievements at national & international
                        level and the establishment of QEC under the guidelines of HEC is one of them. The QEC-UAF was
                        established in 2005. The standard of education in Pakistan is not up to the mark of
                        international
                        standards, as our degree is either not accepted or rarely recognized as compared to other
                        countries
                        degree. To fill this gap and to enhance the overall quality of our education system, HEC has set

                        improvement of education system in the country. The QEC-UAF is involved in surveys related to
                        students, staff and different departments, capacity building of faculty and staff and the
                        facilitating the Self Assessment Process</p>
